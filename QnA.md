What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing this project?

> I believe it's working with Bluetooth, I'm not sure how reliable it can be.


Name two or three features that could be added to this project to improve the user experience.

> user could choose an avatar from a list of predefined and simple drawings

> instead of a list of users, I would show these avatars sparsely distributed in a area, and when someones send karma to the user, his avatar shows a speech ballon with a smile or a positive sign. I believe it would make the experience more personal

> maybe people would like to post to Facebook their Karma

Name two or three limitations of the described product that might cause problems if it were released publicly.

> It doesn't integrates with a web server, to register user profiles

> You could have problems with improper use. Even if the experience is limited to only nicknames, people could register offensive one's and it would appear for everybody. Apps like Post Secret had to shut down because of issues similar to this.

> Many people doesn't has bluetooth enabled by default, so maybe it would be difficult to find people to share karma

How long did this assignment take?

> 12h


What was the hardest part?

> Bluetooth connection. The fact bluetooth changes the peripheral identifier sometimes, producing duplicate avatars on the interface


If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

> To test it on 3 devices, not only two, because that introduced new bugs later


Did you learn something new?

> Yes, the whole CoreBluetooth was new for me


Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

> I think so. Even if I didn't knew CoreBluetooth, I could learn how to work with it fast enough.


Are there any iOS-related skills that you weren't able to demonstrate in this excercise? If so, what are they?

> In my apps I usually use a lot of CoreGraphics drawing, and wasn't able to use it on this exercise
