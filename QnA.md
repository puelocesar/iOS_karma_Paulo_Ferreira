What do you think are the greatest risk areas in completing this project?

> I believe it's working with Bluetooth, I'm not sure how reliable it can be.


Name two or three features that could be added to this project to improve the user experience.

> user could choose an avatar from a list of predefined and simple drawings

> instead of a list of users, I would show these avatars sparsely distributed in a area, and when someones send karma to the user, his avatar shows a speech ballon with a smile or a positive sign. I believe it would make the experience more personal

> maybe people would like to post to Facebook their Karma

Name two or three limitations of the described product that might cause problems if it were released publicly.

> It doesn't integrates with a web server, to register user profiles

> You could have problems with improper use. Even if the experience is limited to only nicknames, people could register offensive one's and it would appear for everybody. Apps like Post Secret had to shut down because of issues similar to this.

> Many people doesn't has bluetooth enabled by default, so maybe it would be difficult to find people to share karma

> It could create a dystopian society, like in the episode of the television series Community where they release a similar app called MeawMeawBeans
